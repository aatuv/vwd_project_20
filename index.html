      <b>1. How the game works</b>
      <p>
        First the player presses the "start game" button. Then a sequence of
        sounds are generated and played so that every button lights up when its
        own sound is played. The player then needs to press those same buttons
        in the correct order to proceed to the next round.
      </p>
      <p>On each round the sequence to remember gets longer and thus harder to remember.</p>
      <p>The player earns 10 points for each correct answer.</p>
      <p>The game ends when the player fails to press the buttons in the correct order.</p>
