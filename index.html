      <b>1. How the game works</b>
      <p>The player's goal is to send the rocket to the moon by passing enough rounds (<b>6</b>) in the game.</p>
      <p>
        A sequence of sounds are generated each round and played so that every button
        lights up when its own sound is played. The player then needs to press
        those same buttons in the correct order to proceed to the next round.
      </p>
      <p>
        On each round the sequence to remember gets longer and thus harder to
        remember.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends when the player fails to press the buttons in the correct
        order, or when they succeed on boosting the rocket to the moon.
